Mutt Icon Animation for WMMail
-------------------------------

Assembled by Rich Lafferty <rich@alcor.concordia.ca

These XPM icons were put together from an animated GIF of the Mutt
dog running back and forth and the classic NEXTSTEP envelope icon.
By using WMMail's Animations settings, you can have a little dog
that runs around when you get new mail -- does it get any better
than this?

On my machine, I get a little dog alone when I've got no mail,
a dog with a letter when I've got read mail, and a dog running
around with a letter behind when I've got new mail. The appropriate
bit of my ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WMMail looks like:

  Animations = {
    Empty = {
      Frames = ("/home/rich/mutt-anim/mutt-nomail.xpm");
    };
    Old = {
      Frames = ("/home/rich/mutt-anim/mutt1.xpm");
    };
    New = {
      Delay = 1;
      Frames = ("/home/rich/mutt-anim/mutt1.xpm",
                "/home/rich/mutt-anim/mutt2.xpm",
                "/home/rich/mutt-anim/mutt3.xpm",
                "/home/rich/mutt-anim/mutt4.xpm",
                "/home/rich/mutt-anim/mutt5.xpm",
                "/home/rich/mutt-anim/mutt6.xpm",
                "/home/rich/mutt-anim/mutt7.xpm",
                "/home/rich/mutt-anim/mutt8.xpm",
                "/home/rich/mutt-anim/mutt9.xpm",
                "/home/rich/mutt-anim/muttA.xpm",
                "/home/rich/mutt-anim/muttB.xpm",
                "/home/rich/mutt-anim/muttC.xpm");
    };

If you prefer envelope-without-a-dog to a dog-without-an-envelope,
then use 'mail-nomutt.xpm' in place of 'mutt-nomail.xpm'.

I found the dog GIF on a handful of Mutt pages including Brandon
Long's at <http://www.fiction.net/blong/programs/mutt/>, and the
mail icon has just been around on my WindowMaker install forever.

Enjoy!
